Here's a step-by-step guide for installing Python and Jupyter Notebook on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Python Installation Guide:

1. **Windows:**
   - Visit the official Python website (https://www.python.org) and go to the Downloads section.
   - Choose the latest stable version of Python for Windows and select the installer appropriate for your system (32-bit or 64-bit).
   - Run the installer and select the option to "Add Python to PATH" during the installation process.
   - Complete the installation by following the prompts.
   - Open the command prompt and type `python --version` to verify the installation. You should see the Python version number.

2. **macOS:**
   - macOS usually comes with a pre-installed version of Python. Open the Terminal app.
   - Type `python3 --version` to check if Python is installed. If not, it will prompt you to install the Command Line Tools for Xcode.
   - Follow the prompts to install the necessary tools.
   - After the installation, run `python3 --version` again to verify the installation. You should see the Python version number.

3. **Linux:**
   - Open a terminal window.
   - For Debian-based systems (e.g., Ubuntu), type `sudo apt update` to update the package lists.
   - Then, type `sudo apt install python3` to install Python 3.
   - To verify the installation, run `python3 --version` in the terminal. You should see the Python version number.

Jupyter Notebook Installation Guide:

1. **Windows, macOS, and Linux:**
   - Open the command prompt or terminal.
   - Install Jupyter Notebook using pip, which is a Python package manager.
   - Type `pip install jupyter` and press Enter.
   - Wait for the installation to complete. It will also install any necessary dependencies.
   - After the installation, type `jupyter notebook` and press Enter.
   - This will launch the Jupyter Notebook server in your default web browser.

That's it! You have successfully installed Python and Jupyter Notebook on your system. You can now create and run Python code in Jupyter Notebook.
